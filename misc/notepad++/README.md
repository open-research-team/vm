## Installation for Notepad++ 6

1. Download the vm.xml.

2. On the Notepad++ toolbar menu select Language->Define your language

3. A user defined language window should open. Click the import button and navigate to the vm.xml file and open it.

4. You may need to re-open your .vm files or restart notepad++ in order to see the highlighting changes.

## Limitation of the notepad++'s syntax highlight

Notepad++'s syntax highlight feature is a little bit limited. For example, the vm language has two types of line comments. Notepad++ seems could not highlight both. so you need to be careful about line comment. I suggest use only one type of comment across all your vm source.
